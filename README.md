### Fork of [cosenary/Instagram-PHP-API](https://github.com/cosenary/Instagram-PHP-API) to make it work with Instagram API v2 and also allow the extra query params

* Added 'public_content' scope to allow this package to work with the new API rules - see not at the top of the readme here: https://github.com/cosenary/Instagram-PHP-API

* Added vkollin's `setAdditionalParameters()` method to allow the use of parameters like `min_id` and `max_id` when making API calls - see his oriogial pull request here: https://github.com/cosenary/Instagram-PHP-API/pull/187
