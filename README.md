## Fork of https://github.com/cosenary/Instagram-PHP-API to make it work with Instgram API v2 and use extra params

# Added 'public_content' scope to allow this package to work with the new API rules - see not at the top of the readme here: https://github.com/cosenary/Instagram-PHP-API

# Added vkollin's `setAdditionalParameters()` method to allow the use of parameters like `min_id` and `max_id` when making API calls - see his oriogial pull request here: https://github.com/cosenary/Instagram-PHP-API/pull/187
